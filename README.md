# Countdown-Timer-with-Pause-and-Reset-Features

The timer application is a program that counts down from a specified amount of time. The user enters the amount of time they want to count down from in minutes and seconds. The timer then displays the countdown in real-time, showing the remaining minutes and seconds.

The timer application should have three features: start, pause, and reset. The start button starts the timer countdown from the specified time. The pause button stops the timer and allows the user to resume the countdown from where they left off. The reset button resets the timer to its original specified time.

The timer should be easy to use and understand. It should display the time remaining in a clear and easily visible format. The user should be able to pause and restart the timer at any point, and they should be able to reset the timer to its original specified time if needed.

Overall, the timer application should be a useful tool for anyone who needs to keep track of time, whether they are timing their workout, cooking, or working on a project. It should be intuitive, easy to use, and provide accurate and reliable timekeeping.
